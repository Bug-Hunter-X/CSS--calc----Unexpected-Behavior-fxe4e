To avoid unexpected results with `calc()`, ensure that the parent container's dimensions are properly defined.  If you are using `calc()` with percentage values, make sure the parent element has a defined width or height.  Also, be mindful of how `calc()` interacts with `min-width` and `max-width`. 

Consider using a more explicit approach, if possible, avoiding complex `calc()` expressions which may be harder to debug. Explicitly setting dimensions on your parent containers can often solve this problem.

Example:
Instead of:
```css
div {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
}
```
Try:
```css
div {
  width: 90%; /* or a fixed pixel value */
  margin: 5px; /* to account for the 10px offset */
}
```
Or if you absolutely need `calc()` ensure that the parent has defined dimensions:
```css
.parent {
  width: 500px;
}

.child {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
}
```

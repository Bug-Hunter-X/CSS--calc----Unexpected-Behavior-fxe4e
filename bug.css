The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, it can sometimes cause unexpected results if not used correctly. For example, if you use `calc(100% - 10px)`, the calculation will be based on the parent container's width, but if the parent container's width is not defined, the calculation will fail. Another example is if you use `calc(100% - 10px)` and have a min-width or max-width defined, the result might be different than what you expected.
